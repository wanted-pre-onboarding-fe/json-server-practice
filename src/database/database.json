Carrie's remarkable \"Blown Away Tour\" launched in the spring of 2012 and continued through May 23, 2013, for a total of 112 dates in 110 cities, six countries, and three continents, playing for more than 1,000,000 fans and selling out every concert this year. By the numbers, the state-of-the-art stage production for the \"Blown Away Tour\" included 575,424 individual LED lights in 3,000 square feet of video walls and an incredible 23,063 feet of cable to generate the 172 different colors used in the show's lighting. As part of each show, Carrie and her band flew 150 feet above the audience on a secondary stage that weighed 5,890 pounds, while CO2 and Nitrogen tanks were used during the life of the tour to create the \"Blown Away\" tornado effect at each performance. Since releasing her debut album in 2005, Carrie Underwood has sold over 15 million albums and chart",

      "description_full": "The film is a tragedy about a veteran theatre actor named Ganpat &quot;Appa&quot; Belwalkar (Nana Patekar) who has been the best of his lot during his heyday, garnering fame and fortune acting in plays based on various works, especially William Shakespeare&#39;s. It is a tragedy of a veteran actor who enjoyed a very vital importance in his life but who becomes the victim of old age alienation and estrangement. The film reveals an intensely tragic fate of an actor who becomes victim of fate and fortune in old age, which is similar to the fate of Lear. Natsamrat suffers the pangs of old age and dishonor inflicted on him by his own children. It is a tragedy of great humanist and actor who succumbs to the ill fate and destiny. In fact, Natsamrat is a story of Ganpatrao Belvalkar, who withstands great suffering after his retirement from stage acting.",

The only time Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) truly feels alive is when he escapes to the OASIS, an immersive virtual universe where most of humanity spends their days. In the OASIS, you can go anywhere, do anything, be anyone-the only limits are your own imagination. The OASIS was created by the brilliant and eccentric James Halliday (Mark Rylance), who left his immense fortune and total control of the Oasis to the winner of a three-part contest he designed to find a worthy heir.
